Air Pollution (NOx) Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) concentration using machine learning regression techniques. Air pollution is a major environmental and public health concern, and accurate prediction of pollutant levels can support environmental monitoring and decision-making.

The project applies predictive analytics to analyze air quality sensor data and compare multiple regression models to identify the most effective approach for NOx prediction.
